 * This loader searches for calls to `compileToString` and wraps its path param

 *
 * It uses a very cheap method of finding calls to `compileToString` by just
 * searching for them using regular expressions.
 *
 * ðŸ“Œ This approach fails when the imported method is being renamed or assigned to
 * another variable, but this keeps things stupid and simple without the overhead
 * of using a AST parser
 *
 * It works as follows:
 *
 * As a quick method of knowing if we can skip doing anything with file we test if
 * compile-to-string has been imported at all and quickly return otherwise
 *
 * We will the find all function calls to compileToString and replace its path param
 * with the same path parameter wrapped in `require('compiled-loader!${originalPath}')`
 * so now that file will be imported (as a compiled string of its sources) using the
 * compiled-loader
 *
 * todo use import() instead of require to create an code-split chunk on the client
